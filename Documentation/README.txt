Hi, i just wanted to share some thoughts about the project in this file:

- Why use RE-Framework for something so simple? I wanted to use good practices even when creating something like this. Of course i could've just put some regExes in a python script and it would do basicaly the same thing but I think that it is the quality that counts here :)
- The only thing missing from the framework are automated tests, I thought that would be an overkill so I got rid of them. Sorry if you wanted me to update them to my process :(
- Some things weren't specified like what to do with the files after I process them or even how is the excel supposed to look like. I asked the questions to myself and my answers are in the code, as you will probably notice.
- I've also put the project on my github: 
- The file seems short but i don't think there is anything left to say about this project from my perspective, feel free to ask me any more questions while we do the tech-talk :)
